with Presearch Tokens for their usage, contribution to, and promotion of the platform.

All this project is based on Selenium. You can install it from here:

# how use
In linux after you install selenium only need to call: "python presearch.py" from your terminal

# to do
This script reads a file (search.txt) to get the words that are used in the presearch search engine.

It is necessary to cure the list of words and have at least a thousand words of the most searched on the internet to get a good presearch score and valid tokens
